A-a-ay, I'm on vacation
Every single day 'cause I love my occupation
A-a-ay, I'm on vacation
If you don't like your life, then you should go and change it

A-a-ay, I'm on vacation
Every single day 'cause I love my occupation
A-a-ay, I'm on vacation
Every single day, every, every single day
Every single day, every, every single day
Every single day, every, every single day-ay

Everybody sour like a lemon tree
I'm just smiling down upon my enemies
Do this shit, and love it on the daily
You say you hate your job, but you'll never leave, never leave

But that ain't gonna be me, that ain't gonna be me
My brother called me up, said he saw me on TV
I said it wasn't easy but right now I'm living breezy
Build this engine from the ground up
Now my hands, they ain't so greasy, feel me?
