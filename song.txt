A-a-ay, I'm on vacation
Every single day 'cause I love my occupation
A-a-ay, I'm on vacation
If you don't like your life, then you should go and change it

A-a-ay, I'm on vacation
Every single day 'cause I love my occupation
A-a-ay, I'm on vacation
Every single day, every, every single day
Every single day, every, every single day
Every single day, every, every single day-ay

Everybody sour like a lemon tree
I'm just smiling down upon my enemies
Do this shit, and love it on the daily
You say you hate your job, but you'll never leave, never leave
